    <title>For UFC Fans (Total Beginners): Conor McGregor vs George Saint Pierre</title>

    <p>
        This is a beginner friendly kata especially for UFC/MMA fans.<br>
        <br>
        It's a fight between the two legends: Conor McGregor vs George Saint Pierre in Madison Square Garden. <br>
        Only one fighter will remain standing, and after the fight in an interview with Joe Rogan the winner <br>
        will make his legendary statement. It's your job to return the right statement depending on the winner!<br>
        <br>
        If the winner is George Saint Pierre he will obviously say:<br>
        <br>
        "I am not impressed by your performance."<br>
        If the winner is Conor McGregor he will most undoubtedly say:<br>
        <br>
        "I'd like to take this chance to apologize.. To absolutely NOBODY!"<br>
        Good Luck!<br>
        <br>
        Note<br>
        The given name may varies in casing, eg., it can be "George Saint Pierre" or "geOrGe saiNT pieRRE". <br>
        Your solution should treat both as the same thing (case-insensitive).<br>
